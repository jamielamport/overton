# Overton Coding Test

## Python
While waiting for WAMP to download i decided to tackle the task in Python where i'm more familiar with Scraping data.

This version can be found in src/python.

## PHP
When WAMP had eventually downloaded and installed I used the python version as a basis to create the solution in PHP instead. So much more I could do 
as I was having fun with the task but i've tried to comment thoughts on what could be changed.

Ideally with more time I would look to refactor the code to make it more reusable and dynamic, although I have attempted this to some degree there is still 
plenty more that could be done.
